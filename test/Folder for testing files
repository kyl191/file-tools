Cases to test:
1. Same file (text/binary, doesn't matter. As long as it's a format we don't attempt to strip metadata from.)
2. Different file, same name. (Again, not a format we try to parse.)

MP3
3. Same file, different metadata (Extract of a CC-licensed MP3 file.)

MP4
4. Same file, different metadata (Small Youtube MP4 file.)
