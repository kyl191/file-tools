Bug fixes

Features
- Dup detection
 - Select * from mp3dedup order by checksum ASC, compare 2, record if dups
 - Another table in db? Dup list should be in memory actually, since we want to recreate the table on the fly.
 - Though, come to think of it, having the list stored in an on-disk db is so we're not too worried about stopping the script mid-run.
 - Hmm. Problem here. Stale data will be stored in the db. Need a way to flush it & update it. Back to the file modification check then... 
 - Should also have a way to purge the db of info, other than opening it up in SQLite browser and manually hitting truncate table.

- GUI
 - PyQT4?
