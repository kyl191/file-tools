Some method of checkpointing & resume from checkpoint.
- Saved file in the main dir?
- Check if there's a record in the db matching the file location of the file to be checked
 - Would prevent re-checksums. What if the file's been modified though? 
  - Add a file last modified column to the db

Bug fixes
- *Seems* to be dying if there's no ID3 data. At least, that's what I'm guessing from the error message "KeyError: 'TIT2'"
